            <h2>Search Engine</h2>
            <p>
                This is a multithreaded search engine built in Java. It began as a semester long project for my Software
                Development class at USF, and I have continued to improve and add to it since. Given a path or URL, this
                search engine will recursively traverse the input, following links or folders until there is nothing
                more to parse. Each file will then be cleaned and parsed into a list of words, those words are then
                stemmed, and added to an inverted index that links them to the paths of the files the word appears in
                and the position(s) in each file.
            </p>
            <p>
                When searching, the query will be cleaned and stemmed (unless the exact search flag is given), and the
                matches will be pulled from the inverted index. The matches are scored based on the number of
                appearances, the length of file, and finally, alphabetically.
            </p>
            <h2>ArgumentParser</h2>
            <p>
                This file is where everything starts. Arguments are passed to the search engine in flag-value pairs.
                This class takes the arguments passed in by the user and parses them into a hashmap with the flags as
                the keys and the values as the values. An argument is considered a flag if it is a dash "-" character
                followed by any character that is not a digit or whitespace. For example, <code>-hello</code> and
                <code>-@world</code> are
                considered flags, but <code>-10</code> and <code>- hello</code> are not.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anything that is not a flag is considered a value. Flags do not have to have an associated value, but
                each value must be preceded by a flag. Any value that does not have a flag is ignored. If a flag is
                repeated, its previous value will be overwrittern.
            </p>
            <h2>(Multithreaded)FileFinder</h2>
            <p>
                The search path that was parsed by the argument parser is then passed to the FileFinder (The
                multithreaded and the single threaded versions of this and other files share the same logic, except the
                multithreaded version adds work to the queue and ensures thread safety for concurrent datastructures).
                It first checks if the path points to a text file or a directory (HTML/website support is in the works).
                If it is a directory, the program walks the directory and passes each file to the word cleaner to parse,
                clean, and stem the words before they are added to the inverted index.
            </p>
            <h2>WordCleaner</h2>
            <p>
                The word cleaner does exactly what it sounds like: it turns a text file into an ordered list of stemmed
                words. First, the text is cleaned by removing any non-alphabetic characters (e.g. non-letters like
                digits, punctuation, symbols, and diacritical marks like the umlaut) and converting the remaining
                characters to lowercase. Next, the text is split by whitespaces and added to an array. Finally, the
                words in the array are then stemmed using SnowballStemmer. The list of stems can then be input into the
                inverted index. This class is also capable of getting rid of duplicate stems (they are kept for
                positioning and count originally), which will be useful for scoring search results later.
            </p>
            <h2>WordIndex</h2>
            <p>
                This is the data structure that is at the heard of this search engine. it is implemented as a
                <code>&lt;TreeMap&lt;String, TreeMap&lt;String, ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>. The outermost
                TreeMap maps the indexed words to the inner TreeMap. The inner TreeMap maps a unique file path to an
                ArrayList. The ArrayList contains the indexed locations of where the word from the outer TreeMap appears
                in each of the locations contained in the inner TreeMap.
            </p>
            <p>
                The words in the WordIndex are sorted in alphabetical order, and the class includes an extensive list of
                methods that can be used to get the number of words, number of appearances in a certain file, a list of
                all of the words, a list of all of the locations for a given word, and several boolean "has" methods to
                check for words, locations, or positions. Appropriate getters and setters are also available, of course.
            </p>
            <h2>WordSearcher</h2>
            <p>
                As the name implies, this takes the (stemmed and cleaned) search query, looks for files in the WordIndex
                that contain words from the query, scores them, and returns them in a nested TreeMap similar to the
                WordIndex. The process is broken up into two steps. First the class goes through the WordIndex and
                collects all of the paths that the words in the query appear in. Then, The results are scored by
                dividing the total word count of the file by the number of appearances in the file. Ties then go to raw
                appearance count, and finally alphabetical order. The results are added to the data structure and
                returned.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the search query (or queries) are stored in a file, that file gets parsed and each line gets
                searched. This class also handles the <code>-exact</code> flag, which specifies whether the words in the
                query need to be exact matches or if stemmed or different tenses are also accceptable.
            </p>
            <h2>PrettyJsonWriter</h2>
            <p>
                This class is used in a few different places throughout this codebase. Almost everything that gets
                output to a file first passes through this class. It is made up of a bunch of helper methods that
                ultimately print out the various nested data structures that are used in this project in a standardized
                and easy to read JSON format. The WordIndex, Results index (returned by the WordSearcher), and the
                counts index are the main things that get written to a file using this class.
            </p>
            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <p>
                This is one of those projects that I return to every once in a while to add to or improve, meaning I am
                constantly relearning how it works and where I left off. That being said, I have a pretty solid idea of
                what I want to do next.
            </p>
            <p>
                First is HTML support. This is what I am currently working on, so there may be some evidence of that in
                the GitHub repo (Due to some complicated importing and copying from school repos, the branches are a bit
                of a mess). The main body of the code should already work with web links, it is just a matter of
                retrieving the HTML, parsing it, and following sub links. After that I would also like to move the
                wordIndex to a SQL database as I believe that would simplify a good amount of the searching and
                inputting I am currently doing. Lastly, creating a proper UI and maybe even turning it into a
                functioning website would be nice.
