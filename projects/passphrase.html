            <h2>Passphrase Generator</h2>
            <p>
                This little CLI app was a product of my laziness combined with my attempt to be more secure with my
                online accounts (It was also an excuse to practice C, which I hadn't used in a while). PassphraseGen is
                a simple C program that generates secure passphrases similar to those created by the diceware method. It
                uses a customizable wordlist and simulates dice rolls to select words, allowing users to tailor the
                number of words, the separator between words, and whether the last word is replaced by a number.
            </p>
            <h2>Dictionary</h2>
            <p>
                Since Diceware is based on a number of standard dice rolls (in this case 4), I needed to create a
                dictionary that allowed me to look up each word based on the numbers that were rolled. the
                populateDictionary function in this file does just that, it reads in the list of words from a textfile
                and populates an array of WordEntry structs, which each hold one word and its corresponding roll.
            </p>
            <h2>Main</h2>
            <p>
                This file handles all of the flags as well as the construction and output of the final passphrase. The
                <code>-i</code> flag allows the user to specify how many words are used to make the passphrase, the
                default being 5 if the flag is not provided. the <code>-s</code> flag allows the user to change the
                separator between each word of the passphrase. The default is "." to get around a lot of sites
                requirements for a special character, but it can be changed to any string or character. Many websites
                also require a number included in the password/passphrase, which is where the <code>-n</code> flag comes
                in. This flag simply appends the 4 digit number that was rolled for the last spot instead of the word
                that it corresponds to.
            </p>
            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <p>
                This is a pretty simple project and I am happy with how it works, so its defintely not a priority for me
                to improve it. If I were to revisit it, I would want to also allow the user to specify how many dice
                should be rolled, which would require the use of a different word list, something a SQL database might
                be useful for. I also think a simple UI would be nice as well.
