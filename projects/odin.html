            <h2>Rock Paper Scissors</h2>
            <p>
                This is just one of several mini projects that I have completed as a part of The Odin Project's
                Foundations course. I was never taught any web development as a part of my degree, so I took it upon
                myself to learn on my own, and this seemed like a great place to start! This part of the course was
                supposed to be an introduction to JavaScript so it isn't incredibly complex, but I thought it would be
                worth sharing anyway to see how far I've come.
            </p>
            <h2>Game Logic</h2>
            <p>
                The logic here is relatively simple: Get the human's choice, choose an option at random for the
                computer, see who wins, update score. The playGame function is where it all starts; it has listeners for
                each button and, for the choices buttons, it calls getHumanChoice. Each button listener also checks the
                score to see who reaches 5 first, which ends the game.
            </p>

            <p>
                This function starts by calling getComputerChoice, which chooses one of the options at random and
                returns it, it then translates the button clicked to a string representing the human choice. Both of
                these strings are then passed to the playRound function. The result of that function is then used to
                update the score. The playRound function is what determines the winner and announces it by updating the
                HTML.
            </p>

            <p>
                There is probably a more elegant way of coding this, but I don't think its too bad for my first dive
                into dynamic web pages!
            </p>

            <h2>What's Next</h2>
            <p>
                Since this was more of a learning exercise than it was a public facing project to show off, I don't have
                any plans on improving it, but I still think it is constructive to take a step back to see what could be
                improved (Plus, who knows maybe I'll get bored one day).
            </p>
            <p>
                The page layout is relatively boring, and doesn't work on small screens. having more than just text,
                like images or more dynamic transitions when the text changes, could make it more engaging and easier to
                take in at a quick glance. As I said above as well, I think the JavaScript logic is a little convoluted and there is
                probably a more streamlined way of writing it that would make it easier to follow when looking at it,
                but it gets the job done.
